# WEB SCRAPER

This script uses the puppeteer library to launch a headless Chrome browser, which means that the browser will run in the background without any graphical user interface. Once the browser is launched, the script creates a new page in the browser and navigates to the URL specified in the URL variable.

The script then uses the cheerio library to load the HTML content of the page and parse it, so that it can extract specific information from the page. In this script, it extracts the text of the first H1 element on the page.

Next, the script locates a button on the page using a jQuery-style selector and clicks on it using the click() method. It then waits for the page to finish loading by using the waitForNavigation() method.

Once the page has finished loading, the script extracts the updated HTML content of the page in the same way as before. Finally, the script closes the browser using the browser.close() method.

Overall, this script demonstrates how to use Puppeteer and Cheerio to automate the process of web scraping, which can be useful for tasks like data mining, content analysis, or testing web applications.
